## Target Aduiences And Super Resolutions

1. What is SuperResolutions
2. What is its application and relation to AI

----

## Project OverView

- What are we doing on this project?
	- so three types of images we doing it for presentation.
- What kind of networks are we using
	- MSRN
	- DenseNet
- How do we show the results ?

----

## Results

* Higher Resolutions means better feature points

## Classification Results

Naive approaches            | SR approaches

## Challenges

* Computation Resources

----

## MSRN is really expensive to train
